<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  This site displays the job requirement information posted online* and displays it in a useful manner.  I decided to do this as I want to expand my career at the moment and I wanted to see what is useful now, and what skills are trending.  In books like the <strong> Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career</strong> it speaks intillegently about investing wisely in yourself, and I decided to look at job listings to see what is exactly being asked for at the moment.

<p>
  One skill that I wanted to improve was my exprience with MVC websites, as well as a dynamic language such as Ruby or Python.  So I decided upon Rails, and this is the first site I have built after running through the <a href='ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book'>Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl (which I completly recommend).  So while I learned rails I wrote a ruby script to count the number of times a skill was listed using <a href='nokogiri.org'>Nokogiri</a>.
